# 3Pixel Website

This is the repo for the frontend of the 3Pixel site. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

If you need help getting started PM **Kaffe#9547** on discord.

## How to Develop Locally

-   Clone the repo
    -   `git clone https://github.com/3Pixel-Organization/website.git`
-   Navigate into the project folder
    -   `cd website`
-   Install the dependencies (you'll need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) for this)
    -   `npm install`
-   Start the development server
    -   `npm start`
-   The site should open on your browser. While the development server is running your changes will reflect on the browser. Head down to [#Learn More](#learn-more) for resources to learn react.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open <http://localhost:3000> to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

If you want to serve the production files locally to test performance I recommend [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve).

```sh
npm i -g serve
serve ./build
```
